The purpose of the noteapp is design web-based note-taking application to help users organize their ideas efficiently.

The app allows users to create, edit, delete, and categorize notes into pages (1, 2, or 3).

On this app,
There is a full stack CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) workflow using:
Node.js and Express.js
MongoDB Atlas
Bootstrap 5 and jQuery. 

In this assignment, while making the app,
I could understand the API endpoints and Environment variable management and deployment on Render. 

##Code Attribution
I wrote all code by myself.
Some configurations and deployment steps referenced from:
Render(https://noteapp-m49y.onrender.com)
MongoDB(https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-database)

I didn't use AI and any external source templates directly.
